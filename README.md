This is a Seller Admin Dashboard Project. In this Project Seller can Add and delete Products based on availability of goods in the stock.
The main focus here is on making the use of crudcrud.com as a temporary backend and integrating the Http request to API's through Postman.
Here we are storing the data in the cloud and performing create, read , update , delete operations in the cloud.
